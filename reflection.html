					★ For the 1st Quarter,
					<span class="table_text">
						Learning the new topics was difficult but engaging and fun once I understood them. 
						I appreciate that Ms. Uminga allows the class to eat during her sessions. 
						Overall, the lessons were really helpful for my coding skills. They helped me make 
						my website more organized and properly designed. Thank you, Ms. Uminga!
