					★ For the 4th Quarter,
					<span class="table_text">
						Learning the new topics was challenging at first, but once I grasped them, they became both engaging and enjoyable. 
						I'm also grateful that Ms. Uminga allows the class to eat during her sessions. Overall, the lessons significantly improved my coding skills,
						helping me make my website more organized and better designed. Thank you, Ms. Uminga!
